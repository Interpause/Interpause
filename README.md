### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### (actually now)

Now that I have adjusted to army life (tm), here are my current priorities:
1. Rewrite MetaTTT using React, Capacitor & Socket.io (preparation for next project)
2. Start blogging on Medium (i.e. how to create a turn-based game with redo/undo)
3. Begin brainstorming game mechanics for a game I have in mind (prepared for by rewriting metaTTT)
4. Rewrite interpause-components to actually be installable (using Bit)
5. Finish <https://interpause.dev> using interpause-components
5. Start competing in Devpost & Kaggle Hackathons

I have also mastered the art of coding on a phone (using <https://gitpod.io> and heavily customized editor themes). This allows me to code even while stuck in camp. Nonetheless, the task of writing metaTTT but with scalability in mind was harder than initially thought. Should be done in a month though.

#### (like 4 months ago)

I'm currently working on a personal site dedicated to boasting about myself, and in the process, I have been learning about ReactJS, even getting sidetracked into making a component library.

I enjoy coding a lot, when I get into the flow, its easy for me to lose track of time. But being indecisive and often procrastinating, I have ended up learning about many different fields of code and gotten decent at quite a few of them.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on a personal site dedicated to boasting about myself, and in the process, I have been learning about ReactJS, even getting sidetracked into making a component library.

I enjoy coding a lot, when I get into the flow, its easy for me to lose track of time. But being indecisive and often procrastinating, I have ended up learning about many different fields of code and gotten decent at quite a few of them.

I graduated from Raffles Institution in 2020, and after NS, plan to join SUTD's STEP Programme. While I learnt many things on my own coding adventures, I also have to thank Tinkeracademy for their brilliant teaching back when I was in Computer Elective.

If you are a beginner looking to learn programmatic thinking, and don't mind the fact I am somewhat obssessed with the fundamental nature of coding (blame my epistemology course), you can email me at: <hyphen@interpause.dev>. I might consider.

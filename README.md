### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### (actually now)

I'm currently serving National Service and hence have gone on a coding hiatus. But I will be back soon.


#### (like 4 months ago)

I'm currently working on a personal site dedicated to boasting about myself, and in the process, I have been learning about ReactJS, even getting sidetracked into making a component library.

I enjoy coding a lot, when I get into the flow, its easy for me to lose track of time. But being indecisive and often procrastinating, I have ended up learning about many different fields of code and gotten decent at quite a few of them.
